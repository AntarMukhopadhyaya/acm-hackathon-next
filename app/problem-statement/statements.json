This calls for automation to be only feasible method to overcome limitations of manual monitoring and reporting. The manual mode may rather be used to better train computer algorithms. A solution should focus on image recognition for species made available in the database. Over the time the database may get richer and thus, making the machine learning better. Such a system should envision cameras installed at the harbors and weigh-bridges, where species may be identified by AI and their proportion (in mixed catch) can be estimated, in order to report the captured biomass effectively and with minimal manual intervention. At present, the catch effort is often the weakest link in stock assessment model. Such harbor-based systems may reduce the errors significantly.
